# Task 4 - Run polling: steps, durations, logs - IMPLEMENTED ✅

**Date:** 2025-09-18
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Commit:** a2ce1cc - feat(run): normalize statuses, durations; show step list + logs; idempotent start

## Implementation Summary

Successfully enhanced the run polling system to track individual step statuses, durations, and display them in a comprehensive UI panel with real-time updates.

## Changes Made

### 1. State Management (`apps/dev-web/src/core/state.ts`)
- **Added `stepDurations` tracking**: New `Record<string, number>` to store duration per node ID
- **Added `setStepDuration` action**: Method to update step durations from polling responses
- **Enhanced run state selector**: `useRunState()` now includes `nodeRunStatuses` and `stepDurations`
- **Updated reset functions**: All reset methods now clear step durations

### 2. Run Actions (`apps/dev-web/src/builder/run/runActions.ts`)
- **Enhanced step processing**: `pollRun()` now captures and stores `durationMs` from API responses
- **Improved step matching**: Better logic to match step IDs to node IDs (exact match or type-based fallback)
- **Duration tracking**: Added `setStepDuration()` calls when processing step updates
- **Idempotency**: Already had proper Idempotency-Key header handling ✅

### 3. Run Panel UI (`apps/dev-web/src/builder/run/RunPanel.tsx`)
- **Steps Section**: New dedicated section showing all workflow nodes with:
  - Node label/type display
  - Real-time status pills (idle/running/succeeded/failed)
  - Duration display (formatted as ms/s)
- **Cancel Button**: Added cancel button that appears during queued/running states
- **Status Pills**: Color-coded status indicators for both overall run and individual steps
- **Duration Formatting**: Smart formatting (ms for <1s, decimal seconds for ≥1s)

## UI Features

### Steps Display
```
Steps
Start Node    [running]    120ms
HTTP Request  [idle]
```

### Status Color Coding
- **Gray**: idle/queued
- **Blue**: running
- **Green**: succeeded
- **Red**: failed

### Cancel Functionality
- Cancel button appears only when run is active (queued/running)
- Calls existing `cancelRun()` stub function
- Provides user control over long-running workflows

## API Integration

The implementation properly processes the backend response format:
```json
{
  "status": "running",
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "node1",
      "status": "succeeded",
      "durationMs": 450
    },
    {
      "id": "node2",
      "status": "running"
    }
  ],
  "logs": [...]
}
```

## Verification

- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ State management correctly tracks step durations
- ✅ UI displays steps with real-time status updates
- ✅ Duration formatting works for both ms and seconds
- ✅ Cancel button shows/hides appropriately
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with existing polling
