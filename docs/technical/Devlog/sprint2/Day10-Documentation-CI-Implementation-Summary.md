# Sprint 2 Day 10 â€” Documentation & CI Implementation Summary

**Date**: September 13, 2025  
**Sprint**: Sprint 2 Final Day  
**Focus**: Documentation freeze, CI expansion, and handoff preparation

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Completed Deliverables

### 1. **API Contract Documentation (FROZEN)** âœ…

**File**: `docs/api/API-Contract.md`

**Key Features**:

- **Frozen `/v1/runs` endpoints** with comprehensive request/response schemas
- **Worked example** featuring Discord webhook integration (matches Sprint 2 test scenarios)
- **Complete validation rules** that align with `packages/workflow-schema` Zod schemas
- **Error handling documentation** with structured error responses
- **Idempotency support** via `Idempotency-Key` header
- **Real-world examples** using the exact Discord payload from the guide

**Schema Alignment**:

- Request/response shapes match `apps/dev-web/src/builder/run/api-contract.test.ts`
- Validation rules mirror `WorkflowSchema`, `HttpConfigSchema`, and `StartConfigSchema`
- Status codes and error formats consistent with implementation

### 2. **User Guide Documentation** âœ…

**File**: `docs/Run-Your-First-Workflow.md`

**Key Features**:

- **Step-by-step tutorial** from empty canvas to executed workflow
- **Discord webhook integration** as primary example (matches Sprint 2 focus)
- **Screenshots placeholder structure** with detailed capture guidelines
- **Troubleshooting section** covering common issues and solutions
- **Next steps guidance** for advancing beyond basics
- **Visual learning approach** with numbered steps and clear expectations

**Supporting Structure**:

- Created `docs/images/` directory with screenshot requirements
- Detailed capture guidelines for consistent documentation
- Links to additional resources (API docs, architecture guides)

### 3. **Expanded CI Pipeline** âœ…

**File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Expanded Coverage**:

- **Multi-package support**: `apps/dev-web` + `packages/workflow-schema`
- **Parallel job execution** for improved build times
- **Comprehensive test matrix**:
  - Typecheck: `dev-web` + `workflow-schema`
  - Build: `dev-web`
  - Unit tests: `dev-web` + `workflow-schema`
  - Integration tests: `orchestrator` (conditional)

**New Test Infrastructure**:

- Added test scripts to `packages/workflow-schema/package.json`
- Created comprehensive unit tests for all Zod schemas
- Optional orchestrator service testing with Docker services (Postgres + Redis)
- Final status check job to ensure all steps pass

**CI Improvements**:

- Better job dependencies and parallelization
- Conditional service tests (only run when services/ changed)
- Enhanced caching and dependency management
- Clear separation between unit and integration testing

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### API Contract Freeze Process

1. **Schema extraction** from existing test files and implementation
2. **Request/response documentation** with real-world examples
3. **Validation rule alignment** with Zod schemas in `workflow-schema`
4. **Error format standardization** across all endpoints
5. **Worked example creation** using the Sprint 2 Discord webhook scenario

### Documentation Strategy

1. **User-centric approach** focusing on visual workflow creation
2. **Problem-solution structure** with troubleshooting guidance
3. **Progressive complexity** from basic to advanced concepts
4. **Screenshot-driven learning** with clear visual anchors
5. **Community integration** linking to resources and support

### CI Pipeline Expansion

1. **Monorepo-aware** job dependencies and caching
2. **Package-specific** test execution with workspace filtering
3. **Service integration testing** with Docker compose services
4. **Parallel execution** where jobs are independent
5. **Comprehensive status reporting** with clear success/failure indicators
