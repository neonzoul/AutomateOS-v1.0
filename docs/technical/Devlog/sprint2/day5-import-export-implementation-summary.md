# Day 5 Implementation Summary – Import / Export (Round‑Trip Safe)

## ✅ Task Completed: Round‑Trip Import/Export of Workflow Graph

### Goal

Enable creators to export the current workflow (nodes + edges + meta) as a JSON file and re‑import it after a refresh with the graph restored identically (IDs, counts). Maintain UX guardrails (one‑click buttons, no raw JSON editing) and validate everything through the shared `@automateos/workflow-schema` Zod schema for round‑trip safety.

### High-Level Outcomes

- Added validated import/export helpers (`exportWorkflow`, `importWorkflow`).
- Introduced store actions (`setGraph`, `clearUiState`) for atomic graph replacement + UI reset.
- Integrated Import / Export buttons into Canvas toolbar (top-left panel) with test IDs.
- Extended shared schema: strict `meta` structure (version literal), richer `EdgeSchema` (handles, data), backward-compatible legacy `metadata` field.
- Added unit tests (valid export, invalid JSON, minimal valid import, schema-invalid import) and an e2e Playwright round‑trip test (node & edge identity check via persisted state).
- Updated Day 5 plan checklist → all items marked complete.

## 1. Schema Enhancements (`packages/workflow-schema`)

**File:** `packages/workflow-schema/src/index.ts`

Changes:

- Added `WorkflowMetaSchema` with: `{ name, version: 1, exportedAt? }`.
- Kept deprecated `metadata` for early callers (non-breaking).
- Expanded `EdgeSchema` → includes `sourceHandle`, `targetHandle`, optional `type`, and `data` record.
- Maintained discriminated union for node types (`start`, `http`).

Why:

- Gives provenance + future evolution path via literal `version`.
- Strict structure ensures deterministic round‑trip and future orchestrator alignment.

---

## 2. Import / Export Helpers

**File:** `apps/dev-web/src/builder/io/importExport.ts`

Features:

- `exportWorkflow({ nodes, edges, name? })` validates before writing file; stamps `exportedAt`.
- `importWorkflow(file)` parses, handles malformed JSON (`code: INVALID_JSON`), validates shape (`code: INVALID_SCHEMA`), returns typed workflow.
- Browser download via ephemeral Blob + `<a>` element (`saveAs`).

Invariants:

- Never export unvalidated structure.
- No secrets or credential data included (Phase 1 rule).

---

## 3. State Store Additions

**File:** `apps/dev-web/src/core/state.ts`

Added actions:

- `setGraph({ nodes, edges })` – atomic replacement.
- `clearUiState()` – resets selection, run status, logs for a clean post-import slate.

Benefit: Clear separation between structural workflow state and transient UI/run state.

---

## 4. Canvas Toolbar Integration

**File:** `apps/dev-web/src/builder/canvas/Canvas.tsx`

Added buttons inside existing top-left panel:

- `<label>` + hidden `<input type="file" data-testid="import-input">` → Import.
- `<button data-testid="export-btn">` → Export.

Error Handling:

- Currently logs to console on failure (toast system placeholder to be integrated later). Toast scaffolding was deferred (low risk follow-up). UI remains one-click compliant.

---

## 5. Testing

### Unit (Vitest)

**File:** `apps/dev-web/src/builder/io/importExport.test.ts`
Cases:

- Valid export triggers Blob creation (URL mocked).
- Invalid JSON rejected (`INVALID_JSON`).
- Minimal graph accepted.
- Schema-invalid node type rejected (`INVALID_SCHEMA`).

### E2E (Playwright)

**File:** `apps/dev-web/e2e/import-export.spec.ts`
Scenario:

1. Open builder.
2. Add Start (if possible) + HTTP node.
3. Click nodes to auto-connect (React Flow click-connect mode).
4. Export -> capture download.
5. Reload page.
6. Import file.
7. Assert node ID set and edge count match original (via persisted `automateos-builder` localStorage snapshot).

Notes:

- Browsers need installation: `pnpm exec playwright install` (otherwise launch errors occur).
- Future improvement: Expose `window.__builderState` for direct, deterministic inspections (TODO left in file).

### Skipped / Existing Tests

- One pre-existing `Canvas` shortcut test remains skipped (unrelated, flagged earlier). Not blocking Day 5 scope.

## 7. Definition of Done Mapping

| Requirement                                 | Status | Evidence                                       |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Export → refresh → import → identical graph | Done   | Playwright test compares node IDs & edge count |
| One-click Import / Export buttons           | Done   | Present in Canvas toolbar (panel)              |
| No raw JSON exposed                         | Done   | Only file download/upload flow                 |
| Validation via shared schema                | Done   | `WorkflowSchema.safeParse` both directions     |
| Error codes for UI messaging                | Done   | `INVALID_JSON`, `INVALID_SCHEMA`               |
| Store reset post-import                     | Done   | `clearUiState()` invoked after `setGraph`      |

## 8. Architecture & DX Benefits

1. **Round‑Trip Determinism**: Ensures exported assets can seed future templates/gallery.
2. **Strict Schema Boundary**: Prevents malformed user graphs entering orchestrator pipeline later.
3. **Easily Extensible**: Adding new node types only touches schema + registry; IO layer unchanged.
4. **Clear Error Surface**: Consistent error codes allow future toast/analytics integration.
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Retaining `metadata` avoids premature breaking changes while new `meta` drives forward model.

---

## 9. Known Follow-Ups (Deferred, Low Risk)

- Integrate toast notifications (replace console) once global feedback system finalized.
- Expose `window.__builderState` (test-only) to remove reliance on localStorage parsing.
- Strengthen edge identity assertion (include full ID arrays when edges become richer).
- Unskip flaky contentEditable shortcut test (separate task — not import/export scope).

## 10. Commands (Reference)

```powershell
# Run unit tests
pnpm -C apps/dev-web test -- --run

# Install Playwright browsers (required before e2e)
pnpm -C apps/dev-web exec playwright install

# Run e2e tests
pnpm -C apps/dev-web test:e2e
```

---

## 11. Conclusion

Day 5 Import/Export feature is fully implemented and validated. The workflow JSON boundary is now deterministic, schema‑enforced, and ready to support future persistence, sharing, and templating features in subsequent sprints. Only minor UX polish (toasts) and testing ergonomics remain as follow-up tasks.

Status: COMPLETE ✅

### Key Lessons

1. Separate view/runtime props from persisted schema early (introduced sanitization step).
2. Always derive export payload from a minimal whitelist to avoid accidental leakage of transient/UI data.
3. Provide an official test bridge (`window.__getBuilderSnapshot`) to stabilize e2e assertions instead of parsing persistence layers.
4. Address hydration stability soon to keep dev console clean and avoid masking real warnings.
5. Keep e2e scenarios tightly scoped (route correctness, deterministic selectors) before expanding device matrix.

### Immediate Small Follow-Ups Suggested

- Implement hydration-safe wrappers for run panel & toolbar state (suppress mismatch).
- Replace localStorage usage in e2e test with snapshot bridge exclusively.
- Add edge creation helper for deterministic Start→HTTP connection (drag source handle to target).
- Introduce toast layer replacing console logs for import/export success/failure.
