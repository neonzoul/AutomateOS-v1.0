# Sprint 1 Deliverable â€” Workflow Builder Scaffold

## Summary

This PR delivers the Sprint 1 scope for AutomateOS: a fully functional workflow builder scaffold with canvas interaction, node registry, persistence, and CI/CD pipeline. Users can create workflows by adding nodes, connecting them, and inspecting their propertiesâ€”all with automatic localStorage persistence.

## What's in this PR

- [x] **Canvas/UX** - React Flow integration with pan/zoom, drag-drop, node connections
- [x] **Node registry** - Start and HTTP nodes with extensible registry system
- [x] **Inspector** - Right panel updates based on node selection
- [x] **Run panel** - Bottom panel shell (ready for Sprint 2 engine integration)
- [x] **Keyboard shortcuts** - Delete key for node removal
- [x] **localStorage persistence** - Auto-save/restore workflows on page refresh
- [x] **CI/DevEx** - GitHub Actions pipeline with install, typecheck, build
- [x] **Docs** - Sprint planning, handover notes, demo instructions

### Changes (high level)

- Enhanced Zustand store with React Flow integration and persistence
- Canvas component with toolbar, node registry, and connection handling
- Inspector panel that dynamically shows node properties
- RunPanel shell ready for backend engine integration
- Comprehensive test suite with Vitest + React Testing Library
- CI/CD pipeline ensuring code quality on every PR
- Docker support for consistent development environment

## Tech Debt & Sprint 2 TODOs

**ðŸ”„ Ready for Sprint 2:**

- Wire RunPanel to backend execution engine (`/api/v1/runs`)
- Add form validation to Inspector (react-hook-form + Zod)
- Expand node registry (File, Database, Transform nodes)
- Implement workflow execution with real data flow

**ðŸŽ¯ Sprint 1 Success Criteria Met:**

- âœ… Canvas loads and accepts nodes
- âœ… Nodes can be connected with edges
- âœ… Inspector shows node properties
- âœ… Workflows persist across sessions
- âœ… CI pipeline ensures code quality
- âœ… Comprehensive test coverage

## CI/CD Status

This PR must have **all CI checks passing**:

- âœ… `pnpm install` (dependencies)
- âœ… `pnpm -C apps/dev-web typecheck` (TypeScript)
- âœ… `pnpm -C apps/dev-web build` (Next.js build)

GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
