# Sprint 1 Handover Notes

## ‚úÖ Sprint 1 Deliverables Completed

### Core Infrastructure
- [x] **Monorepo setup** with pnpm workspace + Turbo
- [x] **Next.js 15** app in `apps/dev-web`
- [x] **CI/CD pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) with install, typecheck, build
- [x] **Docker support** with multi-stage build

### Workflow Builder Core
- [x] **Zustand store** (`src/core/state.ts`) with enhanced selectors
- [x] **React Flow integration** with Canvas component
- [x] **Node Registry** system supporting Start and HTTP nodes
- [x] **Inspector Panel** that updates based on node selection
- [x] **RunPanel** shell (ready for engine integration)

### User Experience
- [x] **Keyboard shortcuts** (Delete key for node removal)
- [x] **localStorage persistence** (auto-save/restore workflows)
- [x] **Responsive UI** with proper panels layout
- [x] **Basic styling** aligned with UX guidelines

### Developer Experience
- [x] **TypeScript configuration** with strict types
- [x] **Testing setup** with Vitest + React Testing Library
- [x] **ESLint + Prettier** code formatting
- [x] **Pull Request template** for sprint handovers

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Tech Debt & Sprint 2 TODOs

### High Priority
- [ ] **Wire RunPanel ‚Üí Backend Engine** (`/api/v1/runs` integration)
- [ ] **Inspector form validation** (react-hook-form + Zod schemas)
- [ ] **Node data persistence** (currently only visual state is saved)
- [ ] **Error handling** for failed connections and invalid workflows

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Expand node registry** (File, Database, Transform nodes)
- [ ] **Improved node styling** (follow UX/UI guidelines more closely)
- [ ] **Import/Export workflows** (JSON serialization)
- [ ] **Undo/Redo functionality** for canvas operations

### Nice to Have
- [ ] **Playwright E2E tests** for full user workflows
- [ ] **Performance optimization** (throttle localStorage saves)
- [ ] **Canvas minimap** for large workflows
- [ ] **Node search/filtering** in toolbar

## üîß How to Run & Validate

### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start dev server
pnpm -C apps/dev-web dev
# ‚Üí http://localhost:3000/builder

# Validate build
pnpm -C apps/dev-web typecheck
pnpm -C apps/dev-web build
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run unit tests
pnpm -C apps/dev-web test

# Run E2E tests (basic)
pnpm -C apps/dev-web test:e2e
```

### CI/CD Validation
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions runs on PRs to `main`
- ‚úÖ Installs dependencies with pnpm
- ‚úÖ Runs TypeScript typecheck
- ‚úÖ Builds Next.js app successfully

## üìä Sprint 1 Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| **Files Created** | ~25 (core components, tests, configs) |
| **Test Coverage** | Basic (store, components) |
| **CI Pipeline** | 3 stages (install, typecheck, build) |
| **Core Features** | 5 (Canvas, Registry, Inspector, RunPanel, Persistence) |
| **User Stories** | 3 (Add nodes, Connect nodes, Inspect nodes) |

## üéØ Sprint 2 Planning

### Primary Goals
1. **Backend Integration** - Wire RunPanel to execution engine
2. **Enhanced Node Registry** - Add 3-5 more node types
3. **Workflow Validation** - Real-time error detection
4. **Data Flow** - Pass actual data between nodes

### Success Criteria
- User can create a workflow and **execute it**
- Workflow results appear in RunPanel
- Node validation prevents invalid connections
- Basic error handling for execution failures

*Sprint 1 successfully delivers a functional workflow builder foundation with persistence, testing, and CI/CD. Ready for Sprint 2 backend integration.*
