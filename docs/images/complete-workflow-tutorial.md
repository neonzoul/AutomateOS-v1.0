# AutomateOS Creator Studio Interface

This is a placeholder for the complete workflow tutorial GIF.

The image shows the AutomateOS Creator Studio interface with:

- Title: "AutomateOS Creator Studio"
- Subtitle: "Open the Builder to start"
- Blue "Open Builder" button
- Clean, professional interface on localhost:3000

To create the actual GIF:

1. Record screen starting from this interface
2. Click "Open Builder" and continue with workflow creation
3. Save as complete-workflow-tutorial.gif

Current status: Placeholder image - needs to be replaced with actual GIF recording.
