From completed the entire core implementation of the `AutomateOS` engine. Week 6 is about preparing for deployment, which means the engine's feature set for this MVP is now complete.

### `AutomateOS` Engine's Abilities

At this stage, your project is a fully functional, albeit minimal, workflow automation engine. It successfully fulfills all the core requirements we set out to build.

Here is a breakdown of its capabilities:

1.  **Multi-User & Secure API:**

    -   You can create multiple user accounts and log in to get a secure JWT access token.
    -   All critical API endpoints are protected; you can only manage workflows that you own.

2.  **Workflow Management (The Control Panel):**

    -   You can use the API to **Create, Read, and Delete** your workflow "blueprints." Each workflow has a name and a JSON `definition` that describes its steps.

3.  **Asynchronous Execution:**

    -   The system is built on an asynchronous, event-driven architecture.
    -   You can trigger any workflow via its unique webhook URL. The API will instantly accept the request and queue a job without blocking, making it fast and scalable.

4.  **Extensible Plugin Architecture:**

    -   The engine's orchestrator can dynamically load and run "nodes" from the `app/engine/nodes/` directory.
    -   You can add new capabilities just by adding new node files, without ever touching the core engine's code.

5.  **Intelligent, Multi-Step Workflows:**

    -   The engine manages "state," passing the output from one node as the input to the next.
    -   You have two working nodes:
        -   **`http_request_node`**: Can make API calls to external services.
        -   **`filter_node`**: Can make decisions and conditionally stop a workflow based on the results of previous steps.

6.  **Complete Execution History:**
    -   The engine records a log for every single workflow run in the database, tracking its status (`Success`, `Failed`) and the final data.
    -   You can use the History API (`GET /api/v1/workflows/{workflow_id}/runs`) to retrieve and review the full history for any of your workflows.

### What You Can Do With It Right Now

With these abilities, you can now build and test real-world automation scenarios from end to end.

-   **You can build a "Webhook to API" bridge:** Create a workflow that is triggered by one service's webhook and uses that data to make an API call to another service.
-   **You can create a "Smart API Monitor":** Build a workflow that is triggered periodically (if you had a scheduling service), calls an important API endpoint of another application, and uses a `Filter Node` to check if the `status_code` is `200`. If not, the workflow would fail, and you could see the failure in your execution history.
-   **You can test complex logic:** You can chain multiple nodes together. For example:
    1.  **Step 1:** `http_request_node` to fetch a list of users.
    2.  **Step 2:** `filter_node` to check if the list is not empty.
    3.  **Step 3:** A (hypothetical) future `email_node` to send a notification.

You have successfully built the complete core of `AutomateOS v0.1`. The next step, as planned, is to make it easy for others (and yourself) to deploy and run this engine anywhere using Docker. Congratulations on completing this major milestone.
