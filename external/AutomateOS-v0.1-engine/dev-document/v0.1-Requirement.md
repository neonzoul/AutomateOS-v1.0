### **Requirements for `AutomateOS v0.1` (Core Engine MVP)**

This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the project.

### ## Core Concept: The Engine

The **"Engine"** is the collection of code and logic that acts as the heart of the workflow processing. It is the **"Orchestrator"** responsible for:

1.  **Loading Workflows:** Fetching the workflow definition from the database.
2.  **Executing Sequentially:** Processing nodes one by one.
3.  **Managing State:** Passing data from one node to the next.
4.  **Invoking Node Logic:** Calling the specific code for each node type.
5.  **Logging Results:** Recording the outcome of each step.

### ## Functional Requirements

_What the system must do._

**1. User & Authentication**

-   The system **must** allow user registration (email/password).
-   Passwords **must** be securely hashed before storage.
-   Users **must** be able to log in to receive a JWT access token.
-   Critical API endpoints **must** be protected, requiring a valid JWT.

**2. Workflow Management (CRUD)**

-   An authenticated user **must** be able to create, read, update, and delete their own workflows via API.
-   A workflow definition **must** contain a sequence of nodes and their configurations.

**3. Asynchronous Execution Engine**

-   Each workflow **must** have a unique, persistent webhook URL.
-   The API **must** immediately queue a job upon receiving a webhook request and return a `202 Accepted` status. It **must not** execute the workflow itself.
-   A background worker process **must** consume jobs from the queue and run the engine logic.

**4. Core Nodes**

-   The system **must** include a functional **HTTP Request Node**.
-   The system **must** include a functional **Filter Node** for conditional logic.

**5. Logging & History**

-   The system **must** record the history and status (Success, Failed) for each workflow run.
-   A user **must** be able to retrieve their execution history via API.

### ## Non-Functional Requirements

_How the system must be built and operate._

**1. üõ°Ô∏è Reliability & Error Handling**

-   The execution of each node **must** be wrapped in a `try...except` block to prevent a single node failure from crashing the entire worker.
-   When an error is caught, it **must** be logged clearly, indicating which node failed and why.

**2. üß© Extensibility & Maintainability (Plugin Architecture)**

-   The system **must** use a plugin architecture. The engine **must not** contain `if/elif` logic for specific node types.
-   The engine **must** use dynamic loading (e.g., with `importlib`) to discover and load available nodes automatically. Adding a new node should only require adding a new file.

**3. üöÄ Performance & Scalability (Asynchronous by Design)**

-   The **API Layer (FastAPI)** is built for speed. It only validates and queues jobs, targeting a response time under 200ms.
-   The **Background Worker (RQ)** is where the Engine runs. All time-consuming tasks happen here, ensuring the API remains responsive.

**4. üîí Security**

-   Sensitive information (passwords, node credentials) **must** be securely encrypted or hashed at rest in the database.

**5. ‚õìÔ∏è State Management & Data Integrity**

-   The engine **must** ensure that the data passed between nodes is correct and complete as designed by the user.

### ## Technical Stack
The required technologies for this implementation.
* **Backend:** Python (3.10+), FastAPI
* **Database:** SQLModel (ORM), PostgreSQL (for production), SQLite (for local development)
* **Job Queuing:** Redis, RQ (Redis Queue)
* **Deployment:** Docker, Docker Compose

---

### ## Deliverables (Definition of "Done")

The final artifacts that must be produced by the end of the 6-week sprint.

1.  A complete source code repository on GitHub.
2.  A `docker-compose.yml` file that starts the entire application stack (API, Worker, DB, Redis) with a single command.
3.  Auto-generated API documentation via FastAPI.
4.  A `README.md` file explaining the project and how to set it up locally.

This updated document now serves as the complete blueprint, detailing not only **what** to build but also **how** it must be built to be robust and scalable.
