what makes a film an immersive experience [Music] locations dialogues soundtrack visual rhythm although we think of rhythm as the sensory data derived from the sound of the film there is another type of rhythm that is evoked by the visuals of the film and is perceived by our image analyzers subconsciously and that concealed rhythm is embedded in colors [Music] as the audience walks through the story one of the most important elements that tells him what to fill are the colors colors contain feeling and meaning and together with

other elements make an immersive world around the story look at the different shades of red color in this movie her they're telling the viewer about isolation loneliness the emotional state of the character and his desire for love and then there is samantha a new possibility for carol and love which is also associated with red the color is almost everywhere in his life from his office to his apartment we can see different shades of red placed beautifully around him and there are also scenes like this one

that using red tells us there are other people in the same situation that the main character is in a message that gets unfolded when he realizes that there are others with the same relationship he has [Music] but the key to use one specific color throughout the film without overusing it is to balance its scene to scene there are scenes with lots of red like this one and there are also scenes that balances the use of red by limiting it to one or two little spots like this one so colors that are mostly used in the

film create a palette together and that color palette creates a rhythm that aligns with the wave of the story colors can tell us about the mood of a scene they can tell about the personality and the inner world of the characters what they are like what they want and even what they've been through colors can also intensify the flow of the story and the changes that happen to form the plot and make it more understandable they can create associations with meanings again in this one red for love

and the absence of red for the absence of love so colors are important in the process of filmmaking as they can retell their story on a subconscious level roger deakins the oscar winning cinematographer says it's easier to make color look good but harder to make it service the story this is why pixar creates a color script for each film to map out the hues for all the scenes to match the visuals with the story arc and make key moments feel appropriately vibrant or sunburned now if we go back to our question

we know that one possible answer is the use of color to tell the story and make it an immersive experience for the eyes of the audience so what do you think you see color as important as we said or you think that there are other film elements that should be considered carefully to create the experience let us know in the comments below and if you liked the video well you know what to do you
